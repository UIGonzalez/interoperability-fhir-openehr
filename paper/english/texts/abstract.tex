\textit{Purpose:} To create openEHR integration archetype from FHIR resource definition in order to  import FHIR resource data in openEHR systems. The interoperability of information systems that support the healthcare process is a crucial factor to ensure proper data continuity.

\textit{Methods:} To find equivalences between data types of FHIR and openEHR is a prerequisite for converting FHIR resource instances to openEHR integration archetypes instances. This work proposes a methodology to find these equivalencies manually, and a process of automatic creation of integration archetypes.

\textit{Results:} Relying on equivalences, a process of automatic creation of archetypes based on a system of types with support for binding to terminologies was designed. The aforementioned process was implemented in python language.

\textit{Conclusions:} The implementing of the automatic process enables the creation of openEHR integration archetypes out of FHIR resources in a shorter time than the manual process, and this assigns the import of FHIR resource data in openEHR systems to the specialists of information technology. Compatibility between FHIR and openEHR data types helps to convert and properly process data from FHIR resource instances into openEHR integration archetypes instances.
