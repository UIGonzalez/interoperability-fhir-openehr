\textit{Purpose:} To create openEHR integration archetype from FHIR resource definition that make it possible to import FHIR resource data in openEHR systems. The interoperability of information systems that support the assistance process is a crucial factor for proper data continuity.

\textit{Methods:} Finding equivalences between FHIR and openEHR data types is a prerequisite for converting FHIR resource instances to openEHR integration archetypes instances. This work proposes a methodology to find these equivalencies manually, and a process of automatic creation of integration archetypes.

\textit{Results:} Relying on equivalences, a process of automatic creation of archetypes based on a system of types with support for binding to terminologies was designed. The aforementioned process was implemented in python language.

\textit{Conclusions:} The implementing of the automatic process enables the creation of openEHR integration archetypes out of FHIR resources in a shorter time than the manual process, and this assigns the FHIR resource data import in openEHR systems to the specialists of information technology. Compatibility between FHIR and openEHR data types helps to convert and properly process data from FHIR resource instances into openEHR integration archetypes instances.
