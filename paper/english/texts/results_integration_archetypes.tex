\subsection{Integration archetypes}

Equivalences between data types and the automated process enables to create integration archetypes based on classes CLUSTER and ELEMENT. These integration ar\-chetypes serve the main purpose of being the entry point of the semantic conversion process for data import to open\-EHR systems. Figure \ref{fig:comparison} shows an extract of a patient integration archetype from side to side, created using the automated process and the patient FHIR resource from which it was created.
