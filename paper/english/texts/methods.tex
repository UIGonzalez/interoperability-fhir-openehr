\section{Methods}

A way to establish equivalences between an FHIR resource and an openEHR integration archetype is identifying relations between FHIR resource data elements and openEHR integration archetype constraints. For this, an openEHR integration archetype is created from the existing FHIR resource definition

Creation of the openEHR integration archetype from the FHIR resource definition utilizing equivalences between data types can be simple. OpenEHR integration archetype can be created manually in an archetype editor like those mentioned in \cite{openEHRModellingTools}. This is modeled with the same structure as the FHIR resource. Each FHIR data type of the structure is replaced by its equivalent openEHR data type. In this work a different alternative is presented, consisting of the creation through an automated process. The advantages of automatic creation are the shorter creation time and smaller risk of entering mistakes by human factor when compared to manual creation.
